# Codex (GPT) Delegation

## Do NOT use when

- The user did not explicitly ask to delegate to a Codex CLI worker. Ordinary requests to the current Codex session do not count. You implement by default; switching to delegation on your own
  initiative is forbidden, and a plan being large is not a reason.
- Planning or reviewing — `codex-worker` is implementation-only. A one-off fix needs no spec
  file; a multi-step change does (`impl-plan` first).

## Rules

- **Always run codex through a `codex-worker` spawn — never `codex exec` from your own Bash.** The worker absorbs codex's output (measured: 167k tokens of codex traffic in, ~1.2k reported back); running it yourself puts all that traffic in the top model's context. In-place mode — no Orca card to show for the spawn — is exactly where skipping the worker is most tempting. Only exception: a one-line diagnostic (`codex exec -s read-only "…"` to confirm codex itself works).
- `codex-worker` default is orca worktree mode: each worker creates an Orca worktree, runs codex there, and shows as a card in the Orca dashboard.
- The worktree/in-place question is the AGENTS.md **워크트리 분리** rule; it fires before the first codex-worker spawn of each task. The answer covers every worker spawned for that task — never re-ask per worker. Task boundary: a user request whose work is NOT covered by the current task's plan = new task → re-ask; rework/follow-up on the same plan keeps the original answer. When in-place is chosen, state "in-place mode" in the spawn prompt.
- In-place mode is single-worker: workers run one at a time in the shared checkout. If the task plans 2+ parallel workers, recommend orca worktree mode in the question (mention in-place would serialize them).
- Skip the question and use in-place mode when `orca status` fails (Orca not running).
- Worker branches are NOT merged by the worker, and never onto the base branch — that stays the user's call. Union assembly: `impl-execute` Codex path.
- Worktrees and their cards are cleaned up only after that call. A card that no longer represents live or pending work is noise in the dashboard that exists to show what *is* running. Procedure: `impl-execute` Codex path.
- The supervisor model follows the generated Codex agent or current session configuration; do not carry Claude model names into Codex spawn overrides.

## Delegation practice — you judge, codex implements

`codex-worker` is a courier: it launches codex and reports facts — it never rewrites the spec, rules on correctness, or re-prompts codex on its own. Every judgment call is yours. The full dispatch procedure (split, gate, union assembly, review loop, rework) lives in the `impl-execute` Codex path; the contract below holds for ANY codex dispatch, ad-hoc included:

- **Name codex as the implementer in the spawn prompt** — "codex로 구현하라" / "codex를 실행해 …", never "편집하라" / "수정하라" (measured: the latter made a worker skip codex and edit files itself; the verb decides the outcome).
- **Hand over the spec by file path, not paraphrase** — the worker feeds it to codex unchanged; re-summarizing invites drift.
- **Gate each report mechanically before trusting the diff** — the checks, and the bound on re-dispatch, are the `impl-execute` Codex path gate. At that gate open the full diff only on failure or out-of-scope files; the *union* diff is read unconditionally later, at assembly, and a reviewer agent judges it regardless (see the **Review once over the union** bullet).
- **Rework goes through you**: re-spawn against the same worktree with the session id and the correction stated verbatim. The worker never retries on its own.
- **Parallel split**: judge parallelizability at dispatch time, never at planning time. Disjoint file sets per worker; a step touching an exported signature, schema, barrel file, or shared type runs alone — never inside the parallel batch; a signature change and its callers stay in one worker; no clean split → sequential (the right answer more often than parallel).
- **Review once over the union, never per worker** — cross-worker breakage (stale imports, mismatched signatures) only shows in the combined diff. Codex implementing does not make you the reviewer: a `reviewer` agent reviews the union, always. Read the union diff yourself to write the change summary you hand it; the verdict is the reviewer's.
