# Artifact Report Format

The architectural review is published as a single Artifact page. Styling, theme tokens, and layout discipline come from the `artifact-design` skill; inline-SVG mechanics from `artifact-diagramming`. Artifacts render Mermaid natively via ```mermaid fences — no external scripts. Mermaid handles graph-shaped diagrams reliably; hand-built divs and inline SVG handle the more editorial visuals (mass diagrams, cross-sections). Mix the two — don't lean on Mermaid for everything, it'll start to look generic.

## Structure

- **Header** — repo name, date, and a compact legend: solid box = module, dashed line = seam, red arrow = leakage, thick dark box = deep module. No introduction paragraph — straight into the candidates.
- **Candidates** — one card per candidate (anatomy below).
- **Top recommendation** — one larger card: candidate name, one sentence on why, anchor link to its card. That's it.

## Candidate card

The diagrams carry the weight. Prose is sparse, plain, and uses the glossary terms without ceremony.

- **Title** — short, names the deepening (e.g. "Collapse the settlement intake pipeline").
- **Badge row** — recommendation strength (`Strong` / `Worth exploring` / `Speculative`), plus a tag for the dependency category (`in-process`, `local-substitutable`, `ports & adapters`, `mock` — see codebase-design's DEEPENING.md).
- **Files** — monospaced list.
- **Before / After diagram** — the centrepiece. Two columns, side by side. See patterns below.
- **Problem** — one sentence. What hurts.
- **Solution** — one sentence. What changes.
- **Wins** — bullets, ≤6 words each. e.g. "Tests hit one interface", "Pricing logic stops leaking", "Delete 4 shallow wrappers".
- **Decision callout** (if applicable) — one line in a warning-tinted box when the candidate contradicts `docs/ADR.md`.

No paragraphs of explanation. If the diagram needs a paragraph to be understood, redraw the diagram.

## Diagram patterns

Pick the pattern that fits the candidate. Mix them. Don't make every diagram look the same — variety is part of the point.

- **Mermaid graph** (the workhorse for dependencies / call flow) — use a `flowchart` when the point is "X calls Y calls Z, and look at the mess." Style with `classDef` to colour leakage edges red and the deep module dark. Sequence diagrams work well for "before: 6 round-trips; after: 1."
- **Hand-built boxes-and-arrows** (when Mermaid's layout fights you) — modules as divs with borders and labels, arrows as inline SVG. Reach for this when the "after" diagram should feel like one thick-bordered deep module with greyed-out internals — Mermaid won't render that with the right weight.
- **Cross-section** (good for layered shallowness) — stack horizontal bands to show layers a call passes through. Before: 6 thin layers each doing nothing. After: 1 thick band labelled with the consolidated responsibility.
- **Mass diagram** (good for "interface as wide as implementation") — two rectangles per module: interface surface vs implementation. Shallow: nearly equal heights. Deep: short interface, tall implementation.
- **Call-graph collapse** — before: a tree of calls as nested boxes. After: the same tree collapsed into one box, the now-internal calls faded inside it.

Keep diagrams compact enough that before/after sits side by side without scrolling; wide content scrolls inside its own container per artifact rules. Module labels inside diagrams should read as schematic (small caps / letter-spaced), not as UI.

## Tone

Plain prose (Korean is fine — the architectural nouns stay canonical), concise. Concision is not an excuse to drift: every architectural noun and verb comes from the `codebase-design` skill — use its canonical terms, never its banned aliases.

**Phrasings that fit the style:**

- "Settlement intake module is shallow — interface nearly matches the implementation."
- "Pricing leaks across the seam."
- "Deepen: one interface, one place to test."
- "Two adapters justify the seam: HTTP in prod, in-memory in tests."

**Wins bullets** name the gain in codebase-design vocabulary: _"locality: bugs concentrate in one module"_, _"leverage: one interface, N call sites"_, _"interface shrinks; implementation absorbs the wrappers"_. Don't write _"easier to maintain"_ or _"cleaner code"_ — those terms aren't in that vocabulary and don't earn their place.

No hedging, no throat-clearing, no "it's worth noting that…". If a sentence could be a bullet, make it a bullet. If a bullet could be cut, cut it. If a term isn't in the codebase-design vocabulary, reach for one that is before inventing a new one.
