description: "Analyze impact scope and create an implementation plan, then validate it through a fresh-context code-review loop until no issues remain. Use this skill when the user asks to plan implementation, create an impl spec, or says \"impl-plan\", \"/impl-plan\". Also trigger when the user has a detailed spec/plan document and wants it verified against actual code."

# Implementation Plan with Code-Verified Review Loop

Write a concrete plan into `docs/impl-spec/`, then have a fresh-context `reviewer` verify every
claim against the actual code. The plan's author has already read the code and glosses over what
it "understands"; a reviewer that starts from scratch catches wrong line numbers, missed callers,
and skipped patterns.

## Do NOT use when

- The change touches under 5 production files — plan inline instead (a risk surface still needs tests and a reviewer per `CLAUDE.md` Hard Rules, not a spec)
- The problem itself is still vague — sharpen it with `grilling` first
- An approved spec already exists and it is time to build — `impl-execute`

## Phase 0: Requirements

- If `docs/PRD.md` exists, load it and find the `## Scope` subsection covering this work.
  If the request contradicts the PRD (`## Non-goals`, or a `## Scope` statement), surface the
  mismatch before planning: an intent change means proposing a PRD update first; a mistaken
  request means correcting course. If the `second-brain` skill's PRD criteria apply and no
  `## Scope` subsection exists, suggest adding it first; proceed without it only on the user's call.
- Before drafting, be able to state: the goal in one sentence, in-scope / out-of-scope, at least
  one pass/fail acceptance check, and the files the change lands in. Anything you cannot state
  from what the user or the PRD said, ask — one question at a time, using a concise plain-text question with
  2–4 concrete options.

## Phase 1: Plan Creation

**Verifying an existing plan** (the user points at a plan document — an active
`docs/impl-spec/` file or any other): skip drafting and numbering — edit that file in place, add
a `risk-surface` field if its frontmatter predates it (an old `tier` field can stay), and go to
Phase 2. For editing a step already marked `[x]`, see the `second-brain` skill's impl-spec
Lifecycle.

1. **Scope analysis** — spawn a `planner` agent with the requirements above. Resolve any
   `## Open Questions` it returns with the user before drafting; nothing downstream reopens them.
2. **Draft the spec** in the Output Format below. The planner's reverse dependencies and existing
   patterns go into `## Affected Dependents` and the steps — the implementer never sees the scope
   analysis, so the spec is how they reach it.
3. **Save** to `docs/impl-spec/<NNN>-<short-description>.md`. `NNN` = highest existing number
   across `docs/impl-spec/` and `docs/impl-spec/archive/` + 1, zero-padded to 3 digits; `001` if
   none. Create the directory if missing.
   - If this plan replaces an existing spec, set the old one's frontmatter to
     `status: superseded-by: <new NNN>` and move it to `docs/impl-spec/archive/`.

## Phase 2: Review Loop

1. Spawn a **new** `reviewer` agent (never reuse one — fresh context is the point) with the spec
   path. It runs in Plan verification mode (`~/.codex/agents/reviewer.toml`). From round 2 on, also pass the
   previous round's disposition table.
2. **Disposition** — for each finding: `ACCEPTED` (fix the spec) or `REJECTED` with concrete
   evidence (file:line or reasoning). "Not needed" without evidence is not a rejection.

   | Finding | Severity | Disposition | Rationale |
   |---------|----------|-------------|-----------|

3. Apply ACCEPTED findings to the spec body. Append REJECTED and out-of-scope findings to
   `## Review Notes` with their rationale, so later reviewers and the implementer see what was
   deliberately declined.
4. **Exit** when a round reports no CRITICAL/HIGH findings. **Cap: 3 rounds.** If CRITICAL/HIGH
   findings remain at the cap, or the same finding keeps coming back, stop: append each open
   CRITICAL/HIGH to `## Review Notes` marked `UNRESOLVED` and tell the user the spec is not
   review-clean — `/impl-execute` must not run on it until those rows are cleared.

## Phase 3: Present

Present the spec path, the risk surface recorded in its frontmatter, what the review rounds
found and fixed, and any remaining MEDIUM/LOW notes. Implementation runs through
`/impl-execute` on this spec — do not start implementing here.

## Output Format

```markdown
---
status: active            # active | done | superseded-by: <NNN>
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
risk-surface: <none | auth | payment | permission | db-schema | public-api>

> NOTE: This is the plan, not a description of the code — never read it as evidence of current code state. While `status: active`, edit it in place as the plan changes; once archived it is frozen.

# [Title]

## Context
[Problem and motivation; reference the PRD section if one exists — never restate it]

## Affected Files
1. `path/to/file.ts` — brief description of change

## Affected Dependents
[Code that must keep working but is not being changed: callers of every signature this touches,
consumers of every export it renames, routes behind a middleware it alters. One line each with a path.]

## Implementation Steps

Every step heading carries a progress marker: `[ ]` unstarted, `[x]` implemented.
`/impl-execute` flips these as it works. Write them all as `[ ]`.

### [ ] Step N: [Title]
**File**: `path/to/file.ts`
- Change description with specific line references
- Code snippets where helpful

## Tests
[Required. Name each test to add or change and the behavior it pins. When `risk-surface` is not
`none`, "none needed" is not an available answer; off the risk surface it needs a reason.]

## Risks
- [Risk and mitigation]

## Verification
- [Commands that prove the change works]

## Review Notes
<!-- REJECTED / out-of-scope findings with rationale; UNRESOLVED rows block /impl-execute. -->

| Finding | Severity | Disposition | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-------------|-----------|
