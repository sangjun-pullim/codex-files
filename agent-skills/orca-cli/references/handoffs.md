## Full Handoffs

A full handoff transfers ownership to another agent or worktree, then the original agent stops. Treat requests phrased as "hand off", "handoff", "handover", "give this to another agent", "give this to another worktree", "another agent", or "another worktree" as full handoffs unless the user explicitly asks to supervise, monitor, wait for results, track completion, coordinate a DAG, use decision gates, or manage ask/reply.

Do not use `orca orchestration task-create`, `orca orchestration dispatch --inject`, or `orca orchestration check --wait` for full handoffs. `task-create` is also forbidden because it records coordinator-owned tracking state; if a task row is needed, the user asked for supervised orchestration. Deliver the prompt with worktree/terminal commands, report the created worktree/terminal if useful, and stop monitoring. A worktree the AGENTS.md **워크트리 분리** rule routed to supervision is **Supervised Dispatch**, not a handoff.

Independent new-worktree handoff:

```text
ORCA worktree create --name <task-name> --no-parent --agent codex --prompt "<task brief>" --json
```

Use `--no-parent` and omit `--base-branch` for independent top-level handoffs unless the user explicitly asks for stacked work, "branch from current", or a specific base. Put any current-branch context in the prompt.

Custom Codex model/effort handoff:

`worktree create --agent codex --prompt ...` launches the known Codex agent but does not accept Codex-specific `--model` or `-c model_reasoning_effort=...` arguments. For requests such as `gpt-5.5 xhigh`, create the independent worktree, launch the requested Codex command there, wait only for TUI readiness if needed to avoid losing input, send the prompt, and stop.

**Extra first terminal:** when no repo default-terminal configuration supplies a primary terminal, bare `worktree create` (no `--agent`) opens a fallback shell before the later `terminal create --command ...` adds the agent. Configured default tabs are materialized instead and may run real commands. Prefer `--agent` whenever the built-in launcher is enough. When custom argv forces the two-step path, target the agent handle only; close a prior terminal only after `terminal list` or `terminal show` confirms it is an unused shell.

The create result's `worktree.id` already contains both pieces Orca needs: `<repoId>::<worktreePath>`. Copy that whole value into the next command; do not shorten it to the repo id.

```text
ORCA worktree create --name <task-name> --no-parent --json
ORCA terminal create --worktree id:<repoId>::<newWorktreePath> --title <task-name> --command 'codex --model gpt-5.5 -c model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"' --json
ORCA terminal wait --terminal <handle> --for tui-idle --timeout-ms 60000 --json
ORCA terminal send --terminal <handle> --text "<task brief>" --enter --json
```

Existing-terminal handoff:

```text
ORCA terminal send --terminal <handle> --text "<task brief>" --enter --json
```
